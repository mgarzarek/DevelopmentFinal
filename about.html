<h3>In 2019, We created</h3>
<p>NYC Development Guide to help those that are new or visiting the area and curious about the new, exciting attractions to look forward to. We created this website to keep up with the sheer volume of public and private developments happening within the city. We promise to provide you with the newest, most accurate reporting in the industry. NYC Developments takes pride in our passion for urban development, rights advocacy, and all thinks New York. Our aim is to keep the information upfront, provide as many images and angles as possible, and let you know when to go and when not to go! We have been working very hard over the past few months to get this site live, and we are always looking for feedback to make it a better experience for everyone. If you have any ideas, comments, or questions, feel free to reach us at IDEA@NYCDEV.ORG
